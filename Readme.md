**Movie Review Sentiment Analysis ðŸŽ¬**
--------------------
A machine learning project built in Python that determines whether a movie review is positive or negative.

# Key Features âœ¨
Text Preprocessing: Implements a standard NLP pipeline to clean and prepare text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing lemmatization.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into a meaningful numerical format that a machine learning model can understand.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trains a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluates its performance with an accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

Interactive Predictions: Features a live prediction mode where you can enter your own text to see the model in action.

# Getting Started ðŸš€
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

#Prerequisites#
You need to have Python (version 3.9 or higher) and pip installed on your system.

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-sentiment-analysis.git
cd movie-sentiment-analysis

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# Create the environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your terminal.)

Run the script:

python main.py

The script will train the model and then prompt you to enter your own movie reviews for classification.

# How It Works ðŸ¤–
The model follows a classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow:

Load Data: The script starts by loading the 50,000 movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

Clean Text: Each review is cleaned to remove irrelevant characters and common words (stopwords).

Vectorize: The cleaned text is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, which measures how important a word is to a document in a collection.

Train: A Logistic Regression model is trained on 80% of the data.

Test: The model's accuracy is tested on the remaining 20% of the data it has never seen before.

# Future Improvements ðŸ’¡
Experiment with more advanced models (e.g., LinearSVC, RandomForestClassifier).

Implement more sophisticated feature engineering techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).

Build a simple web interface using Flask or Streamlit to make the model more user-friendly.Movie Review Sentiment Analysis ðŸŽ¬
